
Node.fs is an F# implementation of the Node.js platform. It is still in extremely early development - so early, in fact, that it can't do much of anything yet, and has no real module system. 
=====================
I aim to keep the API as similar as possible to the Node.js APIs, but due to language differences (and the abundance of reserved words in F#) some things may be slightly different, or be named slightly differently.

However, it can currently run F# versions of simple Node.js apps, such as some of the ones from the Node Beginner Book (http://www.nodebeginner.org).
Here is an example:

open Node.fs.Core.Http
open Node.fs.Core.Console

let http = new http()
let console = new console()

http.createServer(fun (request, response) -> 
    response.writeHead (200, dict["Content-Type", "text/plain"])
    response.write "Hello, world!"
    response.endResponse
).listen(8888)
